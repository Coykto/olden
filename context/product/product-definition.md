## 1. The Big Picture (The "Why")

### 1.1. Project Vision & Purpose

To provide Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era players with a companion toolbox for theorycrafting builds and learning game mechanics — helping them plan strategies outside the game and master its complexity faster.

### 1.2. Target Audience

Players of Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era (Steam) who want to:
- Plan and optimize hero builds before or between play sessions
- Learn and memorize game mechanics, unit stats, and faction details
- Access game data in a convenient, browsable format

### 1.3. User Personas

- **Persona 1: "Alex the Optimizer"**
  - **Role:** Experienced HoMM player, new to Olden Era.
  - **Goal:** Wants to theorycraft optimal hero builds and understand skill synergies before committing in-game.
  - **Frustration:** In-game UI doesn't allow easy comparison of builds or "what-if" planning.

- **Persona 2: "Jordan the Learner"**
  - **Role:** Newer player, overwhelmed by the number of units and factions.
  - **Goal:** Wants to quickly learn unit types, abilities, and faction strengths.
  - **Frustration:** Hard to memorize all units; needs repetition and active recall to learn.

### 1.4. Success Metrics

- Community adoption: players in the HoMM: Olden Era community actively use and share the tool.
- Users can successfully create and compare hero builds.
- Learning tools help players improve their game knowledge (measured by engagement with quiz features).

## 2. The Product Experience (The "What")

### 2.1. Core Features

- **Hero Builder** — Create, customize, and explore hero builds with skills, stats, and equipment.
- **Unit Quiz** — Anki-style flashcard system to learn unit properties (melee/ranged, faction, tier, abilities) from icons.
- **Game Data Browser** — Browse imported game data (heroes, units, items, skills, spells) with images and stats.
- **Game Data Import** — Import and sync data directly from HoMM: Olden Era game files.

### 2.2. User Journey

A player visits Olden Forge, selects a hero from the Hero Builder, assigns skills and equipment, and reviews the resulting stats. Later, they use the Unit Quiz to drill themselves on unit recognition — seeing a unit icon and recalling its faction, tier, and attack type. Between sessions, they browse the game data to research spell effects or compare unit stats.
