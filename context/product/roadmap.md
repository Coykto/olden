# Product Roadmap: Olden Forge

_This roadmap outlines our strategic direction based on player needs and community goals. It focuses on the "what" and "why," not the technical "how."_

---

### Phase 1: Hero Builder Core

_Expand the Hero Builder with essential game mechanics for complete build theorycrafting._

- [X] **Advanced Class System**
  - [X] **Dynamic Class Progression:** Automatically update the hero's class icon when required skills reach expert level, reflecting advanced class unlocks.
  - [X] **Class Tooltips:** Display informative tooltips on class icons explaining the class and its requirements.

- [X] **Equipment System**
  - [X] **Full Equipment Selection:** Allow users to equip heroes with all available in-game equipment items.
  - [X] **Equipment Upgrades:** Support equipment upgrade levels with clear display of alchemical dust costs at the bottom of the equipment window.

- [X] **Spell System**
  - [X] **Spell Selection & Loadout:** Enable users to assign and manage spells as part of their hero build.
  - [X] **Spell Upgrades:** Support spell upgrade levels (without dust cost display, as spells can upgrade without dust).

- [ ] **Army Building**
  - [ ] **Unit/Army Selection:** Allow users to select and configure their army composition as part of the build.

### Phase 2: Persistence & Sharing

_Enable players to save, share, and transfer their builds._

- [ ] **Build Persistence**
  - [ ] **Database Storage:** Save hero builds to the database for retrieval across sessions.

- [ ] **Build Sharing**
  - [ ] **Shareable URLs:** Generate clean, UUID-based URLs for sharing builds (e.g., `/build/abc123`).

- [ ] **Import/Export**
  - [ ] **Build Import/Export:** Allow users to export builds to a portable format and import builds from others.

### Phase 3: Learning Tools & Future

_Features planned for future consideration. Priority may be refined based on community feedback._

- [ ] **Unit Quiz**
  - [ ] **Anki-Style Flashcards:** Create an interactive quiz where players identify unit properties (faction, tier, melee/ranged) from icons.

- [ ] **Skill Probability Analysis**
  - [ ] **Skill Acquisition Percentages:** Display the probability of acquiring each non-starting skill, based on faction and class.
  - [ ] **Build Probability Summary:** Show the overall likelihood of achieving the selected skill combination.

- [ ] **Game Data Browser**
  - [ ] **Enhanced Browsing:** Improve the game data browser with search, filtering, and detailed stat comparisons.
